# Charlie O'Hara / @whalecoiner

Ex frontend developer, now (allegedly) a platform engineer at a Big Company but let's face it, I spend most of my time updating spreadsheets and powerpoint presentations.

I'm a sucker for Home Automation and Self-Hosting. Take a look at my [Home](https://github.com/whalecoiner/home) to see how I manage it all.

Peace out.
