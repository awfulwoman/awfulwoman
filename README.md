# Charface

## Tech history
Once a website builder, now a spreadsheet warrior for an engineering infrastructure department. 

## Nerd interests
I'm a sucker for home automation and self-hosting. Take a look at my [home infrastructure](https://github.com/awfulwoman/home) to see how I manage it all.

## Website
I used to be well into running my own website. But a bad falling out with the modern tech industry burnt me and left me avoiding eye contact with it for years. 

But time heals all wounds and now I'm trying to get back into the whole Indieweb thing.

So far I have:

- ✅ The site [content](https://github.com/awfulwoman/site).
- ✅ A [static site generator](https://github.com/awfulwoman/site) (it's the same repo).
- ❌ An actually published website. Yeah, that's kind of not happened yet. But it'll be at [awfulwoman.com](https://awfulwoman.com)
