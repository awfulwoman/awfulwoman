# Charlie O'Hara / @whalecoiner

Once a website builder, now a spreadsheet warrior. 

I'm a sucker for home automation and self-hosting. Take a look at my [home infrastructure](https://github.com/whalecoiner/home) to see how I manage it all.

I'm trying to get back into building my own website - I'm trying to follow indieweb principles as I do so.

- ‚úÖ The site itself.
- ‚ùå A [Webmention](https://indieweb.org/Webmention) to git endpoint.
- ‚ùå A [Micropub](https://indieweb.org/Micropub) to git [endpoint](https://indieweb.org/Micropub/Servers).
